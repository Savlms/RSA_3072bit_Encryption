# RSA Encryption with 3072-bit Key

This project implements the **RSA encryption** algorithm with a **3072-bit key size** using Python. The script includes functions for key generation, encryption, and decryption of messages. The RSA algorithm is one of the foundational cryptographic techniques used for secure data transmission.

## Features

- **Key Generation**: Generates public and private RSA keys (3072-bit).
- **Encryption**: Encrypts messages using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypts encrypted messages using the private key.
- **Miller-Rabin Primality Test**: Used to check whether a number is prime.
- **Extended Euclidean Algorithm**: Utilized to compute the modular inverse for key generation.

## Files in the Project

- `rsa.py`: The main Python script implementing RSA encryption and decryption.
- `README.md`: This README file with instructions.
